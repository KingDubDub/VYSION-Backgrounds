These are my backgrounds for the TI-84 Plus CE shell VYSION by Epsilon, currently still
in development. I currently have made backgrounds of various calculator forum logos:
- Cemetech
- TI-Planet
- Omnimaga

I also have some others based off of OS's:
- Ubuntu Glitch Wallpaper
- Windows 10 (Build 1909)

And that one meme I found in my edge cache folders after a pinterest meme run:
- degeneracy.png (a.k.a. Lucario as a McDonalds employee in the Pokemon SWSH universe)

I'll be making more and putting them here and in Epsilon's development Discord server.

Note that the yaml will only work with convimg 8.3+, as it's what VYSION is being built
with currently.

Have a bizzare day!
