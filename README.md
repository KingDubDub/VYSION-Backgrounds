These are my backgrounds for the TI-84 Plus CE shell VYSION by Epsilon, currently still
in development. I currently have made backgrounds of various calculator site motifs:
-Cemetech
-TI-Planet
-Omnimaga

I also have some others based off of OS's:
-Ubuntu Glitch Wallpaper
-Windows 10 (Build 1909)

And that one meme I found while running a .png search on my machine:
-degeneracy.png (a.k.a. Lucario as a McDonalds employee in the Pokemon SWSH universe)

I'll be making more and putting them here and in Epsilon's development Discord server.

There are two convimg files, the normal one creates the appvars, the one that has to be
renamed to just "convimg" creates the zx7 compressed versions, which will be needed in
a future release.

Have a bizzare day!
